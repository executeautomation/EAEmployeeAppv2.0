## Features

- **Employee CRUD** — Create, read, update, and delete employee records (Administrators only)
- **Search** — Filter employees by name from the list view
- **PF Contributions** — View employee and employer Provident Fund contributions calculated inline (no external service)
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Two roles enforced via ASP.NET Core Identity:
  - `Administrator` — full CRUD on employees
  - `User` — read-only access to Employee Details (PF & company contributions)
- **Authentication** — Custom login, register, forgot password, change password pages (no scaffolded Identity UI)
- **Modern UI** — Fully redesigned with Bootstrap 5, custom CSS; responsive across pages

- `PFServiceClient` WCF service (replaced by inline calculation)
- `Benefits` and `Role` management modules
- SQL Server dependency (replaced by SQLite)
